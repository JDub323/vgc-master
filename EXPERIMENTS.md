# Experiment record

This file keeps durable conclusions from one-off experiments. The training
scripts and large experimental checkpoints are intentionally not part of the
maintained codebase.

All results below used the same 871,433 training transitions, 46,993
validation transitions, and 46,751-transition held-out test set as the frozen
1x baseline. The baseline is the immutable `baseline` contestant used by
`benchmark.py`.

## Capacity scaling

| model | parameters | best validation loss | test top-1 | recall@6 | recall@16 | perplexity |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1x, d256/L6/ff1024 | 5.8M | — | 0.057 | 0.199 | 0.342 | 142.921 |
| 10x, d640/L12/ff2560 | 61.9M | 5.3283 | 0.078 | 0.266 | 0.427 | 102.718 |
| 100x, d1536/L20/ff6144 | 573.4M | 5.8176 | 0.051 | 0.180 | 0.313 | 167.139 |

The 10x model demonstrated that capacity can materially improve the learned
prior. The 100x model overfit this dataset: training loss continued to fall
while validation loss rose after epoch 3, and its held-out policy metrics were
worse than the 1x baseline. Future scaling work should start near 10x and
spend additional compute on data quality/quantity, regularization, or search
evaluation rather than raw parameter count.

## Damage-token ablation

All variants used the 1x transformer unless noted.

| input/model | best validation loss | validation top-1 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| damage suffix replaced with `DMG_UNK` | 5.4909 | 0.062 |
| damage suffix removed | 5.3659 | 0.065 |
| suffix removed, 5.8M residual MLP | 5.3579 | 0.066 |

Removing the damage suffix did not harm validation policy accuracy and reduced
transformer epoch time from roughly 230 seconds to 107 seconds in these runs.
This suggests the expensive damage matrix was not providing useful supervised
policy signal in the current representation. The residual MLP trained in
roughly 4 seconds per epoch after compilation, but it was not evaluated in
search. Treat it as evidence that architecture/representation efficiency is
worth testing, not as a replacement agent.
